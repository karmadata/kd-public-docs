# KD API Documentation

Explains how KD API works and important concepts.

## Overview

KD API can be split into two major categories: Retrieve APIs and Modify APIs:
* Retrieve APIs - APIs used to retrieve data from the database. It has a syntax akin to a relational database query.
* Modify APIs - APIs used to modify data in the database.

The retrieve APIs are designed to allow flexible querying constructs, so by nature it has a more complex syntax. The Modify APIs are simpler by contrast.

## JSON

KD API is a JSON REST API, so tools like Postman would be a good way to test it. This documentation will show examples of GET/POST requests that access the API.
